# Action RPG

This is a small tutorial project for learning Godot, following a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a) by [HeartBeast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrHQNOyU1q6BFEfkNq2CYMA), go check him out if you're interested.

I will make a commit following every finished episode in the playlist.
